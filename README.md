# Asteroid Radar

This app displays asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth. It allows the user to view all the detected asteroids in a given period of time with data such as the size, velocity, distance to earth and if they are potentially hazardous. It uses NASA's Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) API to fetch the asteroid data and also displays NASA Image of the Day.
